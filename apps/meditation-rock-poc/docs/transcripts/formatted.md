**Rock:** Hello, and welcome. Let’s begin. We’re exploring the theme of “Surviving the winter storm.” Take a moment and settle into your seat. Let your body find a comfortable position. What’s drawing you to this topic today?

**Community member:** I was so afraid that the winter storm will is coming to Boston when I was snowboarding, but because I was with my friend and everyone was so prepared for the snowstorm, it was okay and with a hot chocolate, surviving inside the snowstorm was okay.

**Rock:** Thank you for sharing that. Let’s gently bring our awareness to the sensations that come up for you when you recall that moment. Take a deep breath. Notice how your body feels right now as you reflect on being with your friend, holding that hot chocolate. Where in your body do you feel that sense of relief or warmth?

**Community member:** Because I'm holding a hot chocolate, I can feel warmth in my hand. And is spreading to my heart.

**Rock:** That’s beautiful. Let’s stay with that sensation. Feel the warmth in your hands, and notice how it’s spreading to your heart. Let’s gently breathe into that space. As you breathe, what else do you notice in your chest or around your heart area?

**Community member:** The cold air is coming in through my nose, but still, because I'm holding hot chocolate, it's warm.

**Rock:** Let’s explore that contrast. Feel the cool air entering through your nose, and the warmth radiating from your hands and heart. Notice how both sensations can coexist. What does that balance between cold and warmth tell you about surviving the winter storm?

**Community member:** It feels like, even though it's cold when I'm with my friends who is carrying each other and having a fun moment, I feel like it can be warm.

**Rock:** Yes, that feeling of connection and shared warmth can soften the edges of the cold. Let’s pause here and gently invite your awareness to your heart. What sensations are arising there as you reflect on the warmth of companionship in the storm?

**Community member:** Like, I think being a best friend means that how many meals that we shared each together. And because it was inside the snowstorm, we should cook everything and we always had meals together from the breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And sharing soup, like sharing hot food, warm food, was so great.

**Rock:** That’s a powerful image. Let’s bring that warmth into your awareness now. Notice how sharing those warm meals felt in your body. Where do you sense that feeling of togetherness and nourishment right now?

**Community member:** You mean in my body?

**Rock:** Yes, exactly. In your body. Take a moment and notice where that feeling of togetherness and warmth lives. Maybe it’s a gentle glow in your chest, or a soft fullness in your belly. Let’s explore what’s present for you right now.

**Community member:** Eating soft.

**Rock:** That softness is important. Let’s sit with that soft sensation in your body. As you breathe, notice if it expands or shifts. What is this softness telling you about how you experience surviving the winter storm?
