# Technical rider (C&C 2026 Artworks)

Work type: Interactive installation (physical-digital object + audio + moving image)

Venue reference: “The Street” atrium space at Central Saint Martins (per C&C 2026 requirements)

Run mode: Continuous / looping (self-running)

Indoor/outdoor: Indoor only

Primary audience interaction: Short, voice-only journalling session at a semi-enclosed station; separate listening area provides longer context via looped audio.

## Spatial needs

- Footprint: 3 zones (Entrance / Listening / Interaction) + 1 video monitor placement
- Listening area: space for rock garden display + 1–3 wall-mounted screens (or one large display) + multiple headphone stations
- Interaction area: semi-enclosed booth/station with one featured rock sculpture on plinth/base
- Queue: standing space for small line at interaction station

## Equipment (provided by artist unless otherwise arranged)

- Featured rock sculpture + plinth/base enclosure (houses computer + audio interface)
- Computing: one small form-factor computer to run the rock application
- Interaction I/O: 1 microphone + 1 headset (voice-only)
- UI display: 1 small screen (topic/rock selection UI)
- Listening stations: headphones (quantity TBD) + audio playback hardware as needed
- Displays: 1–3 wall-mounted LCD screens (or 1 large display) for rock backstory + excerpts + prompts
- Ambient video: 1 video monitor playing a looped montage

## Power, networking, and connectivity

- Power: standard mains power for computer(s), displays, and headphone playback (exact wattage TBD)
- Network:
  - Preferred: Wi‑Fi or wired internet for the rock application
  - Fallback: offline/demo mode if internet is unavailable (TBD: confirm capability)

## Lighting / environmental conditions

- Lighting: standard gallery lighting; screens should be readable (no special darkness requirement)
- Sound environment: headphone-based listening to minimize spill; interaction station uses headset (low ambient audio output)

## Audio

- Listening content: looped 10–15 minute audio tracks per rock (curated excerpts from recommender + adopters)
- Output: via headphones only (no loudspeakers required)

## Content on screens

- Rock backstory / teacher attribution (non-sensitive)
- Rotating “key moments” from the community reflection chain
- Selected AI prompts used during sessions (as part of the system trace)

## Operation / staffing

- Self-running after boot; attendants optional but helpful for onboarding and resetting the station
- Visitor session length: ~3 minutes per visitor at the interaction station (tunable)

## Installation / de-rig

- Install tasks: place plinth/booth, mount/connect displays, set up headphones, verify audio routing and UI, start looped video
- De-rig tasks: pack electronics + sculpture; remove any temporary mounts/cable management
- Artist availability: on-site install/de-rig (as required by C&C)

## Safety and compliance

- No soldering or hazardous materials during exhibition operation
- Trip hazards mitigated via cable management and floor tape/covers
- Hygiene: headset/mic wipe-down protocol between users (supplies TBD)

## Shipping / logistics

- Shipping needs: sculpture/plinth + electronics transport to/from venue (TBD: crate dimensions/weight)

## TBD / open questions

- Exact footprint dimensions (L×W×H) per zone; booth size; plinth dimensions
- Quantity of rocks in the “garden” display and whether they are physical, representational, or a mix
- Number of headphone listening stations and whether venue can provide any displays/headphones
- Power draw / number of outlets required; whether a single circuit is sufficient
- Networking requirement details (must-have vs optional) and confirmed offline/demo mode
- Mounting requirements for screens (VESA mounts? wall permissions? stands as backup)
- Accessibility requirements: seated option, wheelchair clearance, captioning/transcripts availability
- Hygiene plan details (replacement ear pads, sanitization frequency, consumables)
- Audio content handling: volume limits, content review needs, and whether any material is sensitive
- Privacy signage/consent language for the interaction station (if any data is collected; ideally none)
- Shipping: crates, weights, insurance, customs (if shipping internationally)
