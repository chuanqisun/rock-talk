# RockTalk — Artist Statement (Interaction)

RockTalk is an AI‑mediated “community garden” for collective reflection. It invites people to speak with a small set of rock‑teachers—each one shaped by a community member’s values—so that private moments of contemplation can become a shared, slowly accumulating commons.

The work begins with a community moderator and a seed participant. Together they “bring a rock to life” by defining a reflective practice the rock will embody (for example: a short guided meditation, a listening exercise, or a prompt style that feels aligned with a particular creative community). The moderator also chooses a topic the community wants to explore together—something timely, difficult, or generative. This topic establishes a “Round”: a bounded period where many people return to the same question, from different places and times.

Each rock has a unique link that can be shared directly with community members. Opening a link brings the participant into a voice‑based session with that rock. The interaction is intentionally simple: you start, you speak, you listen, you pause. The rock guides the participant through a structured reflection—asking open questions, giving space, and gently steering attention back toward the round’s topic. RockTalk is not designed as an all‑purpose chatbot; it is a ritualized encounter with a specific tone and constraint.

At the end of a session, the participant can review what was said and choose what to pass forward. Instead of storing raw personal stories as a public archive, RockTalk asks for a small set of anonymized “memories”: concise, identity‑stripped traces of the session (themes, emotions, insights, bodily sensations, turning points). Submitting these memories is voluntary and framed as a gift to the community.

Over time, the rock’s guidance adapts to the accumulated memory of the round. When a new participant arrives, the rock can weave in gentle echoes of what others have experienced—without quoting anyone directly—creating a felt sense of continuity: that someone else, earlier, wrestled with something similar; that a community can think together without being in the same room.

RockTalk also supports collective gathering. When the community comes together, the moderator can synthesize themes across the round’s memories and use them to guide discussion—turning many solitary reflections into a shared conversation.

In this way, RockTalk proposes a different relationship to AI: not a private oracle that flattens difference into reassurance, but a communal instrument that helps people practice attention, speak carefully, and leave behind small, respectful traces for others.
