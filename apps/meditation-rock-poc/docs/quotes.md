## Guru rock (meditation mode): somatic grounding + “community memory” language

> **Model:** “I hear you. That restlessness is something others have shared too, especially when facing the cold.”

Relevance: This is a clear example of RockTalk’s _asynchronous collectivity_—the rock frames the session as connected to prior participants without naming or quoting anyone.

> **User:** “I’m not quite sure, because it’s so cold that I feel I’m just breathing really fast and really shallow. Is that okay?”

Relevance: Shows the participant bringing real, situated conditions (weather, breath, body) into the interaction—supporting the paper’s claim that the system is grounded in lived context rather than abstract “life advice.”

> **Model:** “It’s absolutely okay. … Let’s just notice that together, without judgment.”

Relevance: Demonstrates the rock’s facilitation stance (non-judgment + gentle pacing), aligning with the paper’s emphasis on structured reflective practice rather than problem-solving.

> **User:** “It feels circulating, but still somehow revolves around my spine.”

Relevance: Captures the kind of embodied, image-rich self-observation RockTalk elicits—useful for arguing that voice reflection can produce meaningful self-attunement without personalization-heavy profiling.

> **User:** “Oh, you are right. I felt my shoulders were so tensed up that I could barely move.”

Relevance: A concrete moment of shift attributable to guided attention—evidence for “small interventions” that support self-discovery (not persuasion or obedience).

> **User:** “But right now, I’m enjoying the smell of the winter and the sunlight … reflecting from the snow.”

Relevance: Illustrates how the “winter storm” round topic can open into sensory appreciation and meaning-making, not just coping—supporting the round’s role as a shared frame that still allows personal interpretation.

> **User:** “Rubbing my hand makes me feel warmer.”

Relevance: A simple, physical action emerging from the session—useful for positioning RockTalk as a tangible ritual (body + environment), not only a conversational interface.

## Mentor rock (mentor mode): emotional meaning + relational warmth + non-judgment

> **User:** “I lost my confidence today.”

Relevance: Shows users using the rock as an entry point for emotional material—supporting the paper’s motivation about creatives turning to AI for affective support (and the need to redesign that support).

> **User:** “It’s a subtle tingling sensation… I think it’s an invitation. For me to relax more.”

Relevance: A strong example of reinterpreting affect through bodily cues, consistent with RockTalk’s aim to scaffold reflection (participants generate insight rather than receive answers).

> **Model:** “That’s a beautiful insight. Let’s gently stay with that subtle tingling sensation.”

Relevance: Demonstrates the “mentor” rock’s tone—affirming without escalating into grand claims—helpful for discussing how rock personalities shape safer, steadier reflection.

> **Model:** “Let’s explore that contrast. Feel the cool air entering through your nose, and the warmth radiating from your hands and heart. Notice how both sensations can coexist.”

Relevance: Highlights the system’s core method (holding tensions rather than resolving them), matching the paper’s framing of collective purpose-seeking as patient, facilitated inquiry.

> **User:** “Even though it’s cold when I’m with my friends… I feel like it can be warm.”

Relevance: Directly connects “surviving the storm” to social support—useful for arguing that RockTalk can redirect AI-mediated reflection toward community and care.

> **User:** “Sharing soup, like sharing hot food, warm food, was so great.”

Relevance: Offers a vivid, communal image that can be used to justify the installation’s material metaphors (rocks/garden/history) and the project’s emphasis on shared rituals over solitary optimization.

> **Model:** “That’s completely natural. Let’s welcome that release as part of the body processing the experience.”

Relevance: An example of non-judgmental facilitation during an awkward moment—useful for discussing how the rock can normalize embodiment and reduce shame, which is central to building trust in communal reflective practices.
