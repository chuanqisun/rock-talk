# Pilot study interaction flow

- Community facilitator invites seed community member to create a rock. The rock will embody the values and practices of the community memory, e.g. meditative or reflective practices.
- Community facilitator decides on a topic that the community wants to explore together. It can be based on timely events or community themes. The topic will be used to create a Round of sessions.
- Each rock is a unique URL that the community facilitator can share with community members.
- Each memory use the unique URL to access the rock and participate in the session.
- After each session, community member submits their anonymized session data to the community memory, associated with the specific rock and round.
- In the future sessions, the rock will adapt and evolve based on the accumulated community memory data, with the goal of connecting community members across space and time.
- When the community gather for discussion, the community facilitator will use the tool to synthesize insights from the community memory data associated with the round and lead the discussion accordingly.
