# RockTalk — Technical Rider (Installation)

This technical rider describes the logistical, spatial, and technical requirements for exhibiting **RockTalk** at C&C 2026.

It situates the software needs within the broader installation. For concept, interaction model, and system framing, see the main paper draft: [docs/paper-draft.md](paper-draft.md).

## Summary

RockTalk is a two-part visitor experience:

1. **Listening station:** visitors listen (on headphones) to a curated “rock” audio program (community memory + prompts).
2. **Session station:** visitors optionally try a short RockTalk session using **headphones + microphone**.

Both experiences are designed for gallery deployment (continuous run mode during open hours) with minimal operator intervention.

## Space & footprint

- **Overall footprint (W×D):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Height / vertical elements:** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Number of stations:** [PLACEHOLDER: e.g., 1 listening + 1 session]
- **Queue area / waiting line (W×D):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Accessibility considerations (wheelchair clearance, seating, captions/signage):** [PLACEHOLDER]

## Exhibit components (what we provide vs. venue provides)

### We provide

- **Laptop (pre-configured)** with the RockTalk web app ready to run.
- **Installation objects / display elements:** [PLACEHOLDER: rock objects, plinths, dock/base, etc.]
- **Signage / instructions (print-ready files):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Spare cables / adapters:** [PLACEHOLDER]

### Venue provides (requested)

- **Stable internet** (wired ethernet preferred; high-quality Wi‑Fi acceptable).
- **Power outlet(s)** within the installation footprint.
- **Audio equipment for visitors:**
  - **Headphones (x[PLACEHOLDER])** for listening and for session privacy.
  - **Microphone solution (x[PLACEHOLDER])**:
    - Preferred: **USB headset(s)** (headphones + mic).
    - Acceptable: standalone mic(s) if paired with headphones.

## Network & internet requirements (critical)

- The experience requires **continuous internet** for real-time AI audio interaction and cloud data storage.
- **Offline mode:** not supported.
- **Latency:** low-latency connection strongly preferred (real-time voice experience).

## Software

RockTalk runs as a browser-based web application with two entry points:

- **Admin interface** (moderator/operator): select a round + rock, manage content, and view synthesized themes.
- **Participant interface** (visitors): run a short voice-based reflection session.

Operational note:

- We will bring a **pre-configured laptop** with the software installed and tested.
- Day-of operation primarily requires launching the browser and opening the prepared URLs.

## Day-of operations & staffing

- **Setup time (install):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Teardown time (de-rig):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **On-site staffing:** [PLACEHOLDER: 1–2 artists/operators during peak hours]
- **Daily start-up checklist:** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Daily shutdown checklist:** [PLACEHOLDER]

## Crowd flow & management

- **Estimated session duration:** [PLACEHOLDER: e.g., 5–10 min]
- **Throughput estimate (visitors/hour):** [PLACEHOLDER]
- **Queue management:** [PLACEHOLDER: stanchions, floor tape, signage]
- **Noise management:** Headphones required; [PLACEHOLDER: additional sound damping / placement]
- **Privacy considerations:** semi-enclosed session area preferred; [PLACEHOLDER]

## Data handling & privacy

- During a session, the system produces a transcript for participant review.
- After the session, the participant may generate anonymized “memory” entries derived from the transcript.
- **Submission is optional** and initiated by the participant.

## Safety, permissions, and compliance

- The session station requires standard browser **microphone permission**.
- No special physical hazards beyond standard AV/installation safety; [PLACEHOLDER: any hardware safety notes].
- [PLACEHOLDER: signage for microphone use / consent / content advisory].
