## Abstract

From writing critique to setting goals, people increasingly turn to AI systems to support reflection and support in creative practice. However these interactions are most often done in solitary contexts with sycophantic models that have a tendency to reinforce existing beliefs, rather than support the active process of self discovery. In contrast, we submit RockTalk: an AI mediated rock garden which facilitates asynchronous wisdom sharing between creatives in a community. Through this installation, we open a window into AI co journalling, a concept which challenges hyper personalized AI experiences, and provides structure for creativity community building. By embedding AI within a tangible, natural, shared interface, Rock Talk proposes experiences with AI that reflect values of committment, shared history, and time, serving as a wide metaphor for the collective desire for stronger connection and real social care.

## Motivation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has quickly crept into the most intimate pockets of our daily lives and creative practices. Creators report using large language models (LLMs) throughout the creative process from describing detailed work schedules to giving feedback \cite{}, but also for attending to the more emotional and spiritual aspects of creative practice, such as working through emotional roadblocks, and untangling the kinds of insecurities that come with creation \cite{}. Given that LLMs have a tendency to reinforce existing beliefs (i.e., sycophancy) \cite{(Cheng, 2025)}, provide whatever answer the user seeks \cite{NEEDED}, and promise spiritual salvation without being embedded in real supportive networks \cite{}, critical creative practitioners have begun asking if the influence of such a disemboded creative partner is worth the trade off.

This questioning exists against the background of a pervaisive loniness epidemic, where creatives feel the looming problems of the loss of community, and spaces to gather. Forming creative community is especially important for working through the great emotional toles of creation \cite{}. In Julia Cameron's widely popular tome of creative practice, _The Artists Way_ \cite{cameron1993artist}, she highlights the need for sharing of guidance between artists of any kind: "QUOTE". Well established forms of wisdom seeking, within and beyond creative practices are often done in community, for example circle practice, prayer, ritual. Relating your experiences and struggles to other humans is a profound and fundamental aspect of the human experience which affords the warmth of collective validation, reduces feelings of shame, keeps us accountable to our goals and values, and allows the creation of strong networks of resource sharing and mutual aid. Artists are particularly relient on community networks.

We are drawn to LLM guidance partially because it offers instantaneous answers, and doesn't require you to burden others with your problems. And yet does this convenient source of answers further isolate us, preventing us from building the collective wisdom skills that emerge from persuring questions of purpose, meaning, and creativity within collective? Never has a technology seemed so well suited to meet our aching desire for answers, and yet interacting with it evokes an ancient Zen Buddhist teaching: "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him."

In this work we seek to challenge this image of a solo person hunched over a chat window seeking life advice, and ask if interactions with an AI model necessarily need to draw away from collectivity. Rock Talk is a community wisdom garden which shares community generated reflective practices through interactive chat bots embedded in rocks. Figure X displays this multi user system.

Our system is fundamentally physical and communal. By embedding AI into rocks, we hope to give users a sense of unity, provide a visual reminder of collective, and promote emotional value in the object users speak to, like the popular “pet rocks” trend.

Each rock in the shared collection represents a spiritual teaching or reflective activity, recommended by someone within the host's creative community, creating a shared resource of reflection grounded in the real people who make up the community rather than distant people lacking the specificities of your own creative community. Community members are invited to adopt these rock teachers, and on their own explore the practice through a voice only interaction deployed through a rock base. When finished with the rock, users return to garden, passing on some part of their session to the rock, allowing a person to learn from them. Communal events hosted at the garden allow collective engagement with the shared wisdoms, giving both asychonrous and sychonous moments to collectively reflect and open up.

In this installation, we share excerts from a proof of concept deployed within the artists own creative community, and give viewers a chance to experience the rock journalling practice hands on. By sharing this work with a broader audience, we ask: Can AI models meaningfully mediate community dialogue?

## RockTalk: Design

![Interaction flow diagram](assets/flow-chart.png)

RockTalk begins with a community facilitator, not a model. The facilitator works with a community member to translate a spiritual practice into a rock. The result is a consistent facilitation stance with a recognizable voice, pacing, and method that reflects the community where it came from.

The facilitator also sets a round topic. A round is a shared inquiry the community holds for a limited period, such as creative fear, rest, or commitment. Each rock and round pairing has a unique link that can be shared widely. Members enter through that link and complete a short guided session.

Within each session, the rock avoids giving sweeping answers. It stays close to reflection and small shifts in attention. The tone is steady and non judging. It can acknowledge collectivity without naming anyone, for example: “I hear you. That restlessness is something others have shared too.” It can also model a patient stance, such as “Let’s just notice that together, without judgment.”

A short transcript excerpt illustrates this stance. In one session, the rock invites the participant to hold two conditions at once: “Notice how both sensations can coexist.” The participant answers by returning the theme to community care: “Even though it's cold when I'm with my friends who is carrying each other and having a fun moment, I feel like it can be warm.” See Appendix A for the full sample transcript.

The round topic keeps the conversation tethered to a shared frame while still leaving room for lived specificity. It gives the garden a way to practice together, even when people arrive at different times.

### Community memory

RockTalk treats each session as both a private encounter and a small contribution to a shared, longer story. After a session, a participant can choose to contribute a brief anonymized trace to the community memory for that specific rock and round. These traces are not treated as quotes to be replayed. They are used as aggregated signals that let the rock speak with a sense of shared history while protecting privacy.

This choice is central to the philosophy of the work. We want to recover lost social rituals around reflection, while resisting the pull toward extraction. The garden does not ask participants to perform intimacy for an algorithm. It asks them to practice attention, then offers a modest way to carry that attention forward for others.

When the community gathers later, the facilitator synthesizes themes from the round and uses them to guide discussion, connecting private practice back to collective care.

### Roles and cadence

The system is designed around two kinds of care.

One is individual care, which is the simple act of being guided into sensation, language, and meaning making.

The other is communal care, which is the slower process of sharing practices, returning to them over time, and letting the community become legible to itself through repeated inquiry.

The rocks provide continuity of voice. The facilitator provides accountability to the community and responsibility for the tone of the practice.

### What the rock is, and what it is not

RockTalk is not a general advice giver. It does not aim to replace teachers, therapists, or friends. It is a structured ritual interface. It is a place where a person can ask a question of purpose and be guided back toward what is already present, then be reminded that this question is held by others too.

## Installation

This installation of the Rock Talk concept gives viewers a window into the Media Lab rock garden of collective wisdom. Displayed as an interactive rock garden (figure X), viewers are invited to interact with unique rock personalities and listen to a curated chain of audio recordings made by past adopters of the rock.

Each rock in the collection is associated with a unique spiritual teacher by makers within the artist's real creative community. Each 10 to 15 minute looped audio track includes a reflection made by the recomender of the reflective practice, along with subsequent reflections made by adopters of the rock and practice. Key moments from this chain of reflections, along with actual prompts made by the AI model while in use allows audiences to consider the system as a whole (see figure X for an example of such a transcript). For a full sample transcript of a guided session, see Appendix A.

To deepen the immersion within this multi user system, a video monitor plays a looped video, showing clips from the individual and collective journalling experience. Additionally, viewers are invited into their own journalling session with one of the rocks in a semi enclosed private environment.

Topic: Surviving the Winter Storm
Round ID: -Ok6s_5aq5Eqk-cp9yzx

Rock: Hello, and welcome. Let’s begin. We’re exploring the theme of “Surviving the winter storm.” Take a moment and settle into your seat. Let your body find a comfortable position. What’s drawing you to this topic today?

Community member: I was so afraid that the winter storm will is coming to Boston when I was snowboarding, but because I was with my friend and everyone was so prepared for the snowstorm, it was okay and with a hot chocolate, surviving inside the snowstorm was okay.

Rock: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s gently bring our awareness to the sensations that come up for you when you recall that moment. Take a deep breath. Notice how your body feels right now as you reflect on being with your friend, holding that hot chocolate. Where in your body do you feel that sense of relief or warmth?

Community member: Because I'm holding a hot chocolate, I can feel warmth in my hand. And is spreading to my heart.

Rock: That’s beautiful. Let’s stay with that sensation. Feel the warmth in your hands, and notice how it’s spreading to your heart. Let’s gently breathe into that space. As you breathe, what else do you notice in your chest or around your heart area?

Community member: The cold air is coming in through my nose, but still, because I'm holding hot chocolate, it's warm.

Rock: Let’s explore that contrast. Feel the cool air entering through your nose, and the warmth radiating from your hands and heart. Notice how both sensations can coexist. What does that balance between cold and warmth tell you about surviving the winter storm?

Community member: It feels like, even though it's cold when I'm with my friends who is carrying each other and having a fun moment, I feel like it can be warm.

Rock: Yes, that feeling of connection and shared warmth can soften the edges of the cold. Let’s pause here and gently invite your awareness to your heart. What sensations are arising there as you reflect on the warmth of companionship in the storm?

Community member: Like, I think being a best friend means that how many meals that we shared each together. And because it was inside the snowstorm, we should cook everything and we always had meals together from the breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And sharing soup, like sharing hot food, warm food, was so great.

Rock: That’s a powerful image. Let’s bring that warmth into your awareness now. Notice how sharing those warm meals felt in your body. Where do you sense that feeling of togetherness and nourishment right now?

Community member: You mean in my body?

Rock: Yes, exactly. In your body. Take a moment and notice where that feeling of togetherness and warmth lives. Maybe it’s a gentle glow in your chest, or a soft fullness in your belly. Let’s explore what’s present for you right now.

Community member: Eating soft.

Rock: That softness is important. Let’s sit with that soft sensation in your body. As you breathe, notice if it expands or shifts. What is this softness telling you about how you experience surviving the winter storm?
